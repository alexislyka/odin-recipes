# odin-recipes
Hi I'm Alexis! I have very little background in coding and computers in general (only really learned a bit in ICT classes in high school) but as my 2nd day and first project with Odin, it has been fun. Applied one paragraph in the Steps for Tomato and Eggs as a tiny sprinkle too.

I've always had interest in a lot of things so it was nice to combine cooking and codes. Can't wait to make these projects fancy as I learn more.
